👋 Hi, I’m @Mulero-Ibrahim, and my name is Ibrahim Mulero. I hold a Distinction in MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and am currently seeking an entry-level position.

👀 I’m interested in various aspects of data, especially analytics/insights, data engineering, or data science.

🌱 I’m currently learning Scala, but I excel in SQL, Python, PowerBi, and Azure cloud computing at this moment.

📫 You can find me on LinkedIn.

⚡ Fun fact: I come from a finance background with a professional qualification in ACCA, which means numbers are not just numbers to me; I see significant value in them.
