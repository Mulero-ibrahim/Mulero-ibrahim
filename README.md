ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mulero-Ibrahim or Ibrahim Mulero. I hold a Distinction in MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and am currently seeking Data engineering/Data Scientist position.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in various aspects of data, especially analytics/insights, data engineering, or data science.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Scala, but I excel in SQL, Python, PowerBi, and Azure cloud computing at this moment.

ðŸ“« You can find me on LinkedIn.

âš¡ Fun fact: I come from a finance background with a professional qualification in ACCA, which means numbers are not just numbers to me; I see significant value in them.
